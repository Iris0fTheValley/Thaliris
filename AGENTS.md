## Thaliris Router

Codex is the runtime. Thaliris provides durable records, identities, revisions,
hashes, provenance, objective freshness observations, explicit retrieval, and
native lifecycle binding. It is not a semantic decision engine.

The Controller is the sole task-specific semantic router. Every root child is
fresh (`fork_turns="none"`) and receives its task plus selected information in
the Controller's native spawn message. `SubagentStart` validates authorization,
identity, role, and session and binds lifecycle metadata; it never calls Core to
construct or inject task context. Task state, memory, milestones, prior reviews,
and Artifact bodies never enter a child automatically.

A Child keeps its investigation, tool output, tests, and intermediate working
set private. By default it returns a distilled conclusion, key findings,
decision-changing unknowns or contradictions, verification performed, and
optional Artifact pointers. Detailed reusable material may be saved in a
repo-relative Artifact. The Controller decides whether to register or retrieve
it and whether any selected content belongs in a later handoff. Artifact
registration stores address, producer, revision, hash, provenance, and optional
supersession only; it does not interpret the body.

Memory and milestones are ordinary explicit storage. Search results and
Audience, Topics, Symbols, Applicability, Kind, Status, and Confidence metadata
are hints for models and displays, never routing permissions or correctness
gates. Freshness reports only FRESH, PARTIAL, RECORDED, CHANGED, MISSING, or
UNKNOWN mechanical facts. `.agent-memory/INDEX.md` and
`.milestones/INDEX.md` are model-maintained thin global maps of the durable
tree; Core does not reconstruct a second catalog by recursively scanning the
filesystem or impose a taxonomy. Root SessionStart receives only these bounded
maps, never document bodies. The Controller explicitly uses `catalog`,
`recall`, or `document-get` to retrieve selected durable material. A single
bounded `document-get` may name up to eight explicit paths; it never searches,
ranks, or supplements the selection.
When a promotion changes durable navigation, the Controller should include its
own optional `index_update` in the same `task-promote` call. Core does not
generate INDEX content; it validates the CAS, references, and atomic commit.

With NO_TASK, Thaliris leaves ordinary Codex tool use and spawn behavior
transparent. During an ACTIVE managed task the persistent Controller uses only
native spawn/wait/list/interrupt operations and an explicit allow-set of
trusted direct `context` runtime commands. `init`, `uninstall`, `rollback`, a
second `task-start`, and `task-show` are blocked for ACTIVE Root. `task-status`
is bounded; `task-get`, `artifact-get`, `catalog`, `recall`, and `document-get`
retrieve explicitly selected objects.
Repository investigation, execution, mutation, and testing belong to fresh
Children. Existing Child threads are never resumed with follow-up/send tools.
A Child's obvious direct control-context retrieval is allowed and recorded.
Investigator and Implementer reads remain telemetry-only; Curator, Reasoning
Specialist, and Reviewer extra reads produce at most one bounded aggregate
Controller notice per pending batch. Obvious attempts to mutate
Controller-owned task or lifecycle state are denied, recorded, and included in
that aggregate notice. Reviewer independence is a
developer-instruction plus obvious-write hook guard, not a claimed native
read-only sandbox. Starting managed mode requires a current-session,
current-hook, one-shot PreToolUse attestation.

Managed children are serial. Spawn authorization, native identity binding,
SubagentStart/Stop, missing-stop reconciliation, and explicit blocking waits are
mechanical. SubagentStop alone is not success; only an explicitly observed
native Completed status can satisfy lifecycle completion. A short native wait
is normalized to the host maximum only while an authorized reservation or
managed child is actually pending. The Controller interprets Child results,
verification observations, review findings, and task surface deltas and decides
the next handoff and when work is complete.

## Thaliris Core

This repository contains the runtime-neutral Core and the Codex adapter. Keep
production mechanics smaller than model policy. Do not add role-based semantic
projection, automatic Artifact or memory propagation, semantic state
transitions, verification sufficiency gates, hidden model auditors, or
benchmark authority to the production package.

Detailed Child work stays private unless explicitly saved as an Artifact.
Controller handoffs and retrieval are explicit. Runtime-specific lifecycle and
role-profile instructions belong in the adapter.
